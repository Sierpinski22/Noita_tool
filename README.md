# Noita_tool

How to use:

Install python (obviously)
Download the file or copy the code
Set the directories to be your own ones (the script will tell you if everything is correct and has a little guide)
Type "help" to see how to use the program

There is an automatic "tutorial" aimed at those who are not familiar with coding

Keep in mind that this program is an experiment, and that moving the wrong files in the wrong directories could result in very bad outcomes
Also, don't load a backup file while you are playing, i don't know what would happen but probably it wouldn't be nice
If you want to edit the code do that at your own risk, but feel free to try and to improve it

Note: I'm just a beginner, and my english in not quite good
